# Project Name Micronode (name generated by AI)

Micronode project. 

This is an experiment to see how far we can get with AI.
There are two rules:
1. Do not do any decisions without consulting AI
2. Do not try to code solution yourself, instead try to suggest corrections to AI to fix the problems.

Let's see how far this goes...
